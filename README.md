# NFLStats
This project is intended for myself to learn and be familarized with Jupyter Notebook as well as the following python libraries:
1.matplotlib
2.pandas
3.nfl_data_py

The nlf_data_py library is a pyhton library full of useful data from the National Football League. One useful set of data is the NFL Next Gen Stats.
With these libraries and jupyter notebooks, I was able to successfully access NFL stats for Running Backs for the 2022 season and display them on a scatter plot.
I look forward to adding more features such as machine learning in order to predict stats such as rushing yards, touchdowns, and etc.
